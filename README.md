## About this project
This was an attempt to make a first person shooter game in Unreal Engine 5. I ended up spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to set up really good movement net code, and when I figured all that out I was kind of burnt out. Maybe some day I will use this code to actually make a game, but for now it is just some starter code ready to be made into a game.
